      <description>The Problem: Mobile One
The Clue: The one true mobile app.
Summary Very common intro mobile crack-me. Decompile apk using method of choice. Search strings for flag. Get flag. Nothing to it.
This challenge could have been completed using the strings tool, but I have become used to just opening .apk&amp;rsquo;s in jadx-gui right away. Usually what I am looking for isn&amp;rsquo;t simply grep-able, so it isn&amp;rsquo;t second nature for me to grep the strings.</description>

      <description>The Problem: firmware.ins (See README for instructions on extracting the image.)
The Clue: Who knew embedded web servers ran PHP natively? And it&#39;s easy to read! Or is it?!
Warning: This challenge&amp;rsquo;s flag reqiures the player to generate the flag by taking an MD5 hash of a defined PHP function named mb_version.
Summary When I submitted the correct flag, I became the 9th person to solve this challenge (with a total of 12 solves at the end of the event).</description>
